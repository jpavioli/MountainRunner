# MOD3-Project

Welcome to Mountain Runner! A harrowing adventure that follows our good friend
Charles, in his quest to run to the other side of the mountain. His journey is
fraught with monsters that try to impede him from ultimate victory.

Try your hardest to avoid the oncoming monsters by jumping using the "Up" arrow
key. Any contact with an oncoming monster will lead to instant death, so try not
to dodge them at all cost!

```

TO SET UP GAME:

1) Download PostgreSQL - Make sure you have a current copy of PostgreSQL on your
   computer in order to host the backend rails server locally.

2) Migrate the Backend - Navigate to the "app_backend" directory, and enter the
   following commands into the terminal:

      rails db:create && rails db:migrate

   the schema for local users and scores will be populated.

3) Start the Server - Run the following code in the terminal to start the
   server:

      rails s

4) Open the HTML Page - First navigate to the "app_frontend". Once there open
   open the "index.html" file to launch the application.

5) Follow the Prompts, and enjoy!

```

User Notes:
- On first launch you must create a new user in order to play
- Deleting a user also deletes any scores associated with that user
- Score is based on total time that Charles can dodge incoming monsters
- The character "Charles" is in no way related to Charles Hitt, Flatiron Student
  in the Software Engineering Cohort 190401
